This directory is intended to be used with Go's http.FileServer to make a
temporary server that implements enough of the provider registry protocol
to test the behavior of "terraform providers mirror".

We can use it by providing a stub instance of disco.Services when testing that
contains a discovery override for whatever hostname the test is using as
the provider's origin registry.
